# What to track

At this stage I'm uncertain about the purposes of storing words separately

#### Full sentences
  * Low granularity but manageable complexity
  *
    
#### Czech Words
  * High granularity
  * Would need target language comprehension questions too 
  * Difficult to track the right Czech words. First outline would be:
    * EQ -> ✓ CA Increase knowledge score for answer words
    * EQ -> x CA Decrease knowledge score for *recommended* answer words
    * CQ -> ✓ EA Increase knowledge score for question words
    * CQ -> x EA Decrease knowledge score for question words
